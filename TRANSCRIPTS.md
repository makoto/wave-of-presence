Here is the demo of Wave Of presence.
The left side is a dapp browser and right side is my phone which is mirrorred.

I now click "Login as a host", which prompts to scan QR code via Uport.

Once scanned I am logged in as a host.

When participants come, they click "Check in as a guest", which prompts the same QR code.

Once the guest Jeff logs in, I click "confirm guest"
which sends a transaction to smart contract recording his checkin information along with who checked him in, which is me.

Once confirmed, now I issue an proof that Jeff came to the event which Jeff can check on his Uport verification list.

Once done, I click "Welcome next guest" to check in other people but I actually want Jeff to help me out.

By refreshing the page I log off so that Jeff can login as an event host helping me checking in more participants.
