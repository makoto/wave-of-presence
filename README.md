# Wave of Presence

"Web of Trust" style event check in system.

## Why?

During meetup and party events, sign up process tend to be the bottleneck as there are way more participants than organisers.
This is a block chain based online check in system where you can delegate the check in capability into participants as volunteers so that you can make check in process more efficient.
